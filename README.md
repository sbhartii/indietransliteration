Sanskrit as Lipi Independent Language
  Sanskrit is a widely spoken language throughout India. Its spoken roughly same manner but written in regional scripts. I have identified 9 scripts for transliteration. Devanagari, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati, Oria, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam.

In general, any indic script is wide and strong enough to represent text from other languages. Like english transliteration, reading some other language known in familiar script is always welcome. Therefore, an attempt to transliterate anything written in one language from its original script into other indic scripts.

  This project creates a simple javascript tool which transliterates text of website instantly. Various advantages to this approach are :-

  Instant : The tool transliterates text instantly on the web page, with no noticeable notice in browsing experience.
  Easily Integrated : As explained on Common Usage Guidelines, the tool can be easily integrated with existing webpages through header and a drop-down menu
  Light weight : Tool currently weights less than 10KB, any noticeable change in browsing experience is minimal.
  Secure : Tool does not transmit/store/play with any data of the website. It may, however, create usage statistics in future, with permission of the website owners.
  Print and Save : Once pages are transliterated, they can be printed and saved in transliterated form too.
  Partial Transliteration : Tool supports partial transliteration of web pages, as some may not have all text in Sanskrit but Hindi or other indic language, though written in Devanagari script or other indic script.
  Google code hosting : Hosted on google code, tool does not eat up share of internet bandwidth of websites, and also provides fast and reliable connection from google code.
